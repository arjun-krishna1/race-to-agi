# race-to-agi
Can you build AGI before "they" do?

## Project definition:
- "Race to AGI" is a strategy game where players compete to develop Artificial General Intelligence
- Through managing resources, conducting research, and navigating ethical dilemmas
- The game focuses on a complex research tree and dynamic events

## MVP features:
- Comprehensive research tree with key AI technologies
- Resource management (funding, computing power, data, talent)
- AI progress tracking with milestones
- Dynamic events and ethical challenges affecting gameplay
- Single-player mode with AI opponents
- Twitter, Hackernews and ProductHunt posts

## Sprinkles
- funny in-joke technologies
  - "raise 7 trillion from Dubai"
  - Leak technology secrets to China
  - "Where is Ilya?"
  - e/acc
  - Endorse Trump
  - "Hot dog or not"
- "I just discoered"... are prompted to share whenever they discover a new technology
- Can invite players and play multiplayer games
- New technologies generated by LLM Gpt-4-mini

## Project completion:
The MVP will be complete when a player can start a game, progress through the research tree, manage resources effectively, and either achieve AGI or lose to an AI opponent.
Simplified components:
a) Research tree system
b) Resource management
c) AI progress tracking
d) Events and challenges system
e) Basic AI opponent logic
f) User interface and game flow

## Addictive elements:
- "One more turn" mechanic: Short-term goals (next research item, resource milestone)
- Unpredictable events: Random challenges and opportunities
- Milestone system: Clear progress indicators
- Competitive element: Race against AI opponents
- Ethical dilemmas: Impactful decisions affecting research and resources

## Built-in viral sharing loops:
- Shareable achievements
- "Challenge a friend" feature
- Unique AI experiment results
- Global leaderboard

## Revised MVP implementation plan:
a) Develop comprehensive research tree with 25-30 key AI technologies
b) Implement detailed resource management system (funding, computing power, data, talent)
c) Design AI progress tracking with 7 major milestones
d) Create 15 impactful events/challenges to add dynamism
e) Develop simple AI opponent logic for competition
f) Design user interface for easy navigation and clear information display
g) Implement basic sharing features (achievements, challenge a friend)
