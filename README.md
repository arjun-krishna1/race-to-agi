# race-to-agi
Can you build AGI before "they" do?

## Define the project:
- "Race to AGI" is a strategy game
- Players compete to develop Artificial General Intelligence
- Combines elements of Civilization's research tree and global influence with Plague Inc.'s dynamic world events
- Players manage resources, conduct research, and navigate ethical dilemmas in their quest to create AGI.

## MVP features:
- Basic research tree with key AI technologies
- Simplified global map for expanding influence
- Resource management (funding, computing power, data, talent)
- AI progress tracking with milestones
- Simple events and challenges affecting gameplay
- Single-player mode with AI opponents

## Sprinkles (future features):
- Multiplayer mode
- More complex ethical scenarios
- Detailed AI testing and validation mechanics
- Advanced graphics and animations

## Project completion:
The MVP will be complete when a player can start a game, progress through the basic research tree, expand on the global map, and either achieve AGI or lose to an AI opponent.
Breaking down into components:
a) Research tree system
b) Global map and influence mechanics
c) Resource management
d) AI progress tracking
e) Events and challenges system
f) Basic AI opponent logic
g) User interface and game flow
Addictive elements through compelling gameplay:


"One more turn" mechanic: Always have short-term goals (next research item, expanding to a new region) that players can achieve quickly
Unpredictable events: Random challenges that keep each playthrough fresh
Milestone system: Clear progress indicators that give a sense of accomplishment
Competitive element: Race against AI opponents creates urgency and engagement
Ethical dilemmas: Thought-provoking decisions that impact the game and create emotional investment


Built-in viral sharing loops:


Shareable achievements: Players can post their major AI breakthroughs on social media
"Challenge a friend" feature: Players can invite friends to beat their time to AGI
Unique AI experiment results: Players can share interesting or unexpected outcomes of their AI development, encouraging discussions and attracting new players
Global leaderboard: Showing fastest times to AGI, incentivizing competition and sharing


MVP implementation plan:
a) Develop basic research tree with 15-20 key AI technologies
b) Create simplified global map with 5 regions for expansion
c) Implement resource management system (funding, computing power, data, talent)
d) Design AI progress tracking with 5 major milestones
e) Create 10 impactful events/challenges to add dynamism
f) Develop simple AI opponent logic for competition
g) Design user interface for easy navigation and clear information display
h) Implement basic sharing features (achievements, challenge a friend)

By focusing on these core mechanics and viral elements in the MVP, we can create a compelling and addictive game that encourages players to keep playing and share their experiences, potentially attracting new players organically.
